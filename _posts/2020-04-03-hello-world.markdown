# Hello World

### Welcome to my new home.

Despite the thumbnail incinuating the use of php, this site is built using the static site builder, [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:title="Jekyll - Static site generator"}{:target="_blank"} and hosted with [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/){:title="Github Pages"}{:target="_blank"}.

Jekyll takes text written in your favorite markup language and uses layouts to create a static website. You can tweak the siteâ€™s look and feel, URLs, the data displayed on the page, and more.

With GitHub Pages you can create a website directly from a GitHub repository.


### Why have I done this?

As a developer, I'm entirely capable of keeping my site up to date by writing code but the use of markdown keeps this to a minimum. Using a static site generator ensures the site remains lightning fast at all times.

### How does the contact form work?

As there isn't a server behind the scenes I'm using [Formspree.io](https://formspree.io/){:title="Formspree"}{:target="_blank"} to power my contact form.

Formspree allows developers to build HTML forms with the markup in any structure they like. On submission of the form, the data is handled by Formspree's API. Formspree forms can perfectly match your website by inheriting your website's CSS.
